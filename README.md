# Iris-Flower-Classification

## This is the machine learning model which learns to classify three category of flowers, named Satosa, Versicolour and Virginica based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. Used Logistic regression as classification model.

I have used Jupyter notebook for better demonstration. In this project, Iris Dataset is used for the classification task in machine learning. Iris dataset consists of four columns containing sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width of three categories of flower named Satosa, Versicolour and verginica. Our task in this project is to classify the three categories of flowers on the basis of sepal and petal length width. LogisticRegression is used for the classification task.
